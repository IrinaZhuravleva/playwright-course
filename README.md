## Web Automation Test Suite
Welcome to the Web Automation Test Suite, a ready-to-use automation framework built using best practices and advanced techniques from modern web automation. This project is designed to be scalable, reliable, and easily integrated into your CI/CD pipelines, ensuring smooth automated testing for your web applications.

## 🚀 Features
Automated Testing with Modern Frameworks
Written with [Playwright/Selenium], leveraging the power of modern testing frameworks for browser automation.

## Page Object Model (POM)
The project follows the Page Object Model architecture for organized, reusable, and maintainable code.

## Retries and Robustness
Tests include built-in retries for handling flaky tests, ensuring that temporary network or server issues don't cause false failures.

## Network Interception and API Mocking
The suite allows manipulation of network requests, including the ability to mock or intercept API responses to test different scenarios.

## CI/CD Integration
Fully compatible with CI tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and CircleCI for continuous integration and deployment.

## Comprehensive Reporting
Automatically generates test reports to visualize test runs and results.

## 🛠️ Project Structure
The project is structured to allow for easy navigation and scalability:

```
📦 web-automation-test-suite
 ┣ 📂 src
 ┃ ┣ 📂 page_objects
 ┃ ┣ 📂 test_cases
 ┃ ┗ 📜 test_suite.js
 ┣ 📂 reports
 ┣ 📂 config
 ┣ 📜 .gitignore
 ┣ 📜 package.json
 ┣ 📜 README.md
 ┗ 📜 ci-config.yml
 ```

src/ - Contains all test cases and page objects, organized for modularity and reuse.
reports/ - Test reports generated after running the tests.
config/ - Configuration files for environment setup and test execution.
.gitignore - Specifies which files and directories to ignore in the project repository.
ci-config.yml - A sample CI configuration file for setting up CI pipelines.

## 📝 How to Use
1. Clone the Repository

2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then install all project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the Tests
To execute the test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

This will run the automation tests in the browser and generate a report.

4. View Test Reports
After the test run, view the generated reports located in the reports/ folder to analyze the results.

5. CI/CD Integration
To integrate this project with a Continuous Integration system (like GitHub Actions or Jenkins), follow the example configuration provided in ci-config.yml. Modify the file according to your CI setup, and you're good to go!

##  📖 Requirements
Node.js (v14 or higher)
npm (v6 or higher)
Modern web browsers (for running the tests locally)
A GitHub account for version control (if needed for CI/CD)

## 📦 Dependencies
The project relies on the following key dependencies:

Playwright - For browser automation
Mocha/Jest - Test framework for running test cases
Chai - Assertion library for writing clear and flexible tests
Allure - For generating detailed and visual test reports
You can install all dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```
